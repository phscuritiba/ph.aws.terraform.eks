# General
# If not existis, create a public and private key with command:
# sudo ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -v -f /home/aws-testing.pem
# Do not enter a password when creating the keys
#
# The public key will be created in the following path: '/home/aws-testing.pem.pub'
# and will be registered on AWS under the name 'aws-testing'. This public key will
# be associated with the EC2 instances during the creation of the cluster and this
# way you will be able to access them via SSH in the future using the private key
# that is in '/home/aws-testing.pem'.
